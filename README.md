# -MLEnd-mini-project
Predictive audio/intonation of numbers model


This project would collect the data from Machine learning class 2020/2021 @ QMUL

The data would be collected by audio recognition such as 0-9(digit), 10-100(tenth), Thousand, Million, and Billion.

This project will provide two solutions which consist of Basic Solution and Advanced Solution

Basic solution would consider the model as below and using accuracy as a metric
